@Naji4
Master’s student and aspiring data scientist, passionate about turning messy datasets into actionable insights. While I’m currently exploring healthcare data (because sometimes numbers can save lives), I also dive into other domains—because good data deserves attention no matter where it comes from.

What I Do->
Build smarter models (or at least attempt to).
Clean data that should come with a "hazardous" label.
Spot patterns hiding in plain sight, across industries.
Let’s Collaborate->
Got a data challenge? Let’s solve it: nmoha253@gmail.com

My favorite machine learning model? The one that works right before the deadline -_-
