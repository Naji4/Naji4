# Hi, Iâ€™m Naji ðŸ‘‹  

Masterâ€™s student in Data Science, passionate about extracting insights from complex datasets. While I focus on healthcare analytics, I also explore macroeconomics and sociologyâ€”because data shapes everything around us.  

## What I Do  
- Clean and analyze messy datasets to uncover patterns.  
- Build machine learning models that (hopefully) make smart predictions.  
- Explore cross-disciplinary data, from health to economic trends.
